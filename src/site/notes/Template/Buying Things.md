# Minimalism Buying Framework

## Before You Buy
- Is this item essential for my daily life or well-being? 
- Will I use this item regularly (at least once a week)?
- Does it serve a clear purpose that no other item in my possession fulfills?

## Affordability
- Can I afford this without compromising my financial stability?
- Is this the best use of this money?

## Quality & Longevity
- Is this the highest-quality option available within my budget? 
- Will this item last for years, or will it need frequent replacement?

## Space & Clutter
- Do I have space to store it without creating clutter? 
- Will I still want or need this item in 5 years?

## Mindful Alternatives
- Can I borrow or rent this item instead of buying it?
- Is there a second-hand or refurbished option that meets my needs? 

## Timing
- Have I waited at least 30 days to decide if I truly need it? (For non-urgent purchases) 

## Avoid Duplicates
- Do I already own something similar?
